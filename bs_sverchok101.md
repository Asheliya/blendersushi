The best way to start in Sverchok is to start by using some of the Generators nodes provided by Sverchok. For example, some of my favourites are: SV Line, SV Circle, and SV Grid.

Shift+A is the Hotkey I often use to quickly search and find the node by name.
Ctrl+Space inside node tree to get a nicer categorized list of nodes.

Generators node usually requires *Viewer Node* or *Viewer BMesh* in order to generate a usable preview or to generate real Object in 3D View.

It is up to you how you want to explore Sverchok, whether you want to work in Object ID level or more in deep components level.

The most interesting part of Sverchok for me is how it handles List of List and Array. You will soon understand data in this format [[]] and [[[],[],[]]].
