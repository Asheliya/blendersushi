The best way to start in Sverchok is to start by using some of the Generators nodes provided by Sverchok. For example, some of my favourites are: SV Line, SV Circle, and SV Grid.

Shift+A is the Hotkey I often use to quickly search and find the node by name.

Generators node usually requires *Viewer Node* or *Viewer BMesh* in order to generate a usable preview or to generate real Object in 3D View.
