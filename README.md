============

This is the SECRET VAULT of Blender Sushi related scripts and node trees setup created for Blender 3D.

TOOLS USED:
- Sverchok Add-On
- Animation Nodes Add-On

This is an ongoing "ebook" to share my brain with everyone.

I am using Blender 3D as a tool to express my ideas and to share my endless study of everything related to computer graphics, animation, and visualization. After a series of coincidents, I stumbled into cool add-on like Sverchok and Animation Nodes and also meeting some awesome Blender Artists and Developers.

This freedom of expressions using freely available tools helps me a lot to really play with code and node. I gain more confident in programming, especially using Python. Even at a basic-intermediate level this knowledge helps me in creating a lot of things that is not possible.

I tried to keep all my tools open source so that no matter what computer I am on, I can just install all the tools without worrying about license and dependencies with paid apps.
